                            <p>Donald Knuth is an American computer scientist, mathematician, and professor emeritus at Stanford University. He is the author of the multi-volume work The Art of Computer Programming.Knuth has been called the "father of the
                                analysis of algorithms".

                                <p>Jon Von Newman was a Hungarian-American pure and applied mathematician, physicist, inventor, computer scientist, and polymath. He made major contributions to a number of fields, including mathematics (foundations of mathematics,
                                    functional analysis, ergodic theory, geometry, topology, and numerical analysis), physics (quantum mechanics, hydrodynamics and quantum statistical mechanics), economics (game theory), computing (Von Neumann architecture,
                                    linear programming, self-replicating machines, stochastic computing), and statistics. He was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum mechanics, in the development of functional analysis, and a key
                                    figure in the development of game theory and the concepts of cellular automata, the universal constructor and the digital computer. He published 150 papers in his life: 60 in pure mathematics, 20 in physics, and 60
                                    in applied mathematics.
